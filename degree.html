                      <p>The profession of teaching is one of the most prestigious in the world. In today's society, teachers are highly respected and valued. Teaching is viewed as a challenging and demanding career. A teacher is accountable not just for instructing his or her students, but also for developing them into good citizens and human beings.</p>
                      <p>Qualified teachers are scarce in India. Students make up a large percentage of the Indian population. In addition, the teacher-to-student ratio in India is insufficient. This could be one of the main causes for India's increasing demand for academics. As a result, this segment of the population requires education. As soon as students pass Class XII, they can enroll in teacher training courses in India. These courses are open to students from various disciplines, including Science, Commerce, and the Arts and Humanities. Top names in this stream include courses like B.Ed, B.El.Ed, D.El.Ed, JBT and BTC.</p>
