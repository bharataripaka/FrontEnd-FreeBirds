 <h1>Science</h1>
 <p>Science is the most popular and favorite career option for the majority of the parents and students.  Science stream offers many lucrative career options such as engineering, medical, IT and student can even opt for research roles.The best advantage of choosing science stream is, it keeps your options open. The student can switch from science to commerce or science to arts. But it is not possible to do the other way around.Taking science stream equips you with excellent problem-solving abilities.Science and math offer a flexible foundation which enables students to accomplish highly respected and well paid jobs.</p>
 <p>Science stream is the most popular choice among 10th standard passed students in India. Students who want to pursue pure and applied science professional courses in the future can choose this stream.</p>
 <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
 <p>Candidates can pursue a course in Science at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels:</p>
 <p>Intermediate Level: should clear Class 10 in any stream with minimum 50%-60% from a recognized board.</p>
 <p>UG Level:Candidates should clear Class 12 in any stream with minimum 50% - 60% marks from a recognized board.</p>
 <p>PG Level:Candidates should clear graduation preferably in the subject in which they wish to pursue masters with minimum 50% - 60% aggregate marks.</p>
 <p>It may be noted that Science eligibility criteria mentioned above might vary depending on the policy of the university or college in which a candidate is applying for admission.</p>
 <h2>Science Stream Boards Available in India</h2>
 <p>There are four main education boards available in India. Students may choose a stream that suits them best. The choice shall be made on the basis of difficulty level associated with the boards and aptitude of the student. The names of the boards are-</p>
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.cbse.gov.in/" target="blank">CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cisce.org/" target="blank">ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ibo.org/" target="blank">IB (International Baccalaureate)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apbe.co.in/" target="blank">State Boards</a></li>
 </ul>
 <p>IB is the toughest board among the above mentioned entries. It focuses on the concept of ‘how to learn’. Much emphasis is laid on ‘application of knowledge’ and ‘practical aspects’ of learning.</p>
 <p>IB board is followed by ICSE board, when it comes to difficulty level. Then comes CBSE board. I think most of you are aware about this board. It functions under the Union Government of India. Difficulty level associated with this board is moderate.</p>
 <p>Last comes State Boards. Each State in India has its own education board. It functions under the respective State Governments of each state. Language of instruction (medium) in case of schools affiliated to such boards are- regional language and English.</p>
 <h2>List of Subjects for Science Students</h2>
 <h3>Physics</h3>
 <p>Physics is one of the old academic fields in the world and the science of matter, motion, energy, and force. It mainly focus on understanding how the universe behaves. Advances in the field of physics enable advancements in technologies, such as the study of electromagnetism, thermodynamics, mechanics, nuclear physics and solid-state physics.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Kinematics</li>
      <li>Laws of Motion</li>
      <li>Thermodynamics</li>
      <li>Electrostatics</li>
      <li>Electromagnetic Waves</li>
      <li>Electronic Devices</li>
      </ul>
  <h3>Chemistry</h3>
  <p>Everything in the universe is made out of atoms and matter, and the study of Chemistry is based on the study of the composition, properties, and structure of matter, including atomic structure and the changes influenced by chemical reactions.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure</li>
      <li>Chemical Thermodynamics</li>
      <li>Organic Chemistry</li>
      <li>Chemical Kinetics</li>
      <li>Surface Chemistry</li>
      </ul>
<h3>Biology</h3>
<p>The term ‘Biology’ is derived from the Greek language, with ‘bios’ meaning life and ‘logos’ meaning study, literally translating into the study of life forms. And that’s exactly what biology is. Biology studies living organisms – plants and animals – including facets such as their physical structures, physiological mechanisms, chemical processes, molecular interactions, and development and evolution.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Structural Organization in Plants and Animals</li>
      <li>Cell: Structure and Function</li>
      <li>Plant Physiology</li>
      <li>Human Physiology</li>
      <li>Genetics and Evolution</li>
      <li>Biotechnology and its Applications</li>
      </ul>
  <h3>Mathematics</h3>
  <p>Mathematics is a science of numbers and is often the most hated subject for students, and sometimes the most loved with use in money transactions and applications even in architecture, art, engineering, and sports. As a subject, Math focuses on the concepts of quantity, change, structure, and space.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Algebra</li>
      <li>Calculus</li>
      <li>Mathematical Reasoning</li>
      <li>Linear Programming</li>
      <li>Probability</li>
      <li>Vectors and Three-Dimensional Geometry</li>
      </ul>
  <h3>English</h3>
  <p>As one of the official languages of India, and as the language used most commonly worldwide, English is an unavoidable subject studied at Class 11-12 level regardless of the stream. English is a common language medium used in offices, colleges and online, which is why a certain level of proficiency is always helpful.</p>

  <h2>Intermediate  </h2>
          <p>The Intermediate Education, also known as Higher Secondary Classes (HSC), is a two-year course 
            conducted by the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education. Is one of State secondary education boards of India.
            The board currently offers 85 streams and courses.
            </p><p>BIEAP offers general and vocational groups. 
            <i>General groups</i> include Science, Humanities, and Commerce studies. In these groups, students learn theory and practice. That helps them to choose and pursue higher studies at the graduate level in both professional and general courses. 
            <i>Vocational groups</i> are meant to educate students and train skills related to their branch of study. It will help them to get immediate self-employment or continue higher education.
            </p><p>Every student in BIE studies their subjects and receives practical training. They are also working towards environmental improvement, learning ethics and moral values to become a responsible, committed, and patriotic citizen of their country. The aim is to make them the "Nation's Potential Human Resource".

  <h2>UG Courses available after 12th Science:</h2>
    <p>Based on the range of programs available and student enrollment, the two most popular types of undergraduate college degrees are associate's degrees and bachelor's degrees. An associate's degree is at the shortest duration of the two as it usually takes two years to complete, while a bachelor's degree requires four years of study. Credits obtained from an associate's degree can normally be applied to a bachelor's degree program.</p>
    <dt><b> Associate's Degrees:</b> </dt>
    <p>Associate's degrees are typically offered by community colleges and trade schools with awards for general subject areas at this level being conferred as an Associate of Arts (A.A.) or Science (A.S.). More vocational associate's degree programs are available for students looking for more specific professional training. These vocational options include the Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) or even more focused degrees such as the Associate's Degree in Nursing (ADN).</p>
    <dt><b> Bachelor's Degrees:</b> </dt>
    <p>Another common undergraduate degree is the bachelor's degree. Bachelor's degrees are offered at all universities and 4-year colleges in the U.S. The most commonly awarded bachelor's degrees are the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and the Bachelor of Science (B.S.). Some colleges may also offer more specialized degrees such as the Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) or Bachelor's of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.). The award of B.A. is typically for programs in the humanities and social sciences, and the award of B.S. is usually for traditional science programs, although this can vary from one institution to another.

    Data reported by the National Center for Education Statistics in 2019 suggests that the most popular bachelor's degree programs are in business, health, history and psychology.</p>
