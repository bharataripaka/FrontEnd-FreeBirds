     <!-- boards  -->
    <h2> The Commerce stream boards that are available in India</h2>
        <p>There are 4 main educational boards in India. The students have the liberty to choose the board that they are comfortable with. The choice can be made according to the degree of difficulty associated with the syllabus. The educational boards’ names are mentioned below –</p>
        <dd><a href="https://www.cbse.gov.in/" target="blank">CBSE – Central Board of Secondary Education</a></dd>
        <dd><a href="http://icseindia.org.in/" target="blank">ICSE – Indian Certificate of Secondary Education</a></dd>
        <dd><a href="https://ibo.org/" target="blank">IB – International Baccalaureate</a></dd>
        <dd><a href="#">State boards</a></dd>
        <p>International Baccalaureate is the most complex board amidst the above mentioned educational boards. It concentrates on the notion of ‘how to learn’. A great deal of prominence is placed on  ‘knowledge application’ and ‘practical aspects’ of studying</p>
        <p>IB is followed by the ICSE board when it comes to the complexity level. Later comes the CBSE board, which is one of the popular boards in India. It comes under the purview of Union Government of India. Difficulty level related to this board is average.</p>
        <p>Finally, coming the State Boards. Every state in India holds its own board of education. It is regulated under the respective State Governments of each state. The medium of instruction (language) in case of schools allied to state boards is the regional language of the respective state and English</p>
        <!-- subjects -->
        <h2><b>List of Subjects for Commerce Students</b></h2>
        <p>Commerce, as a course of education, can be interpreted as a study of business and trade pursuits such as the exchange of goods and services from the producer to the final customer. The important subjects that are taught under the Commerce stream in Class 12 comprise Accountancy, Economics, Business Studies, Statistics, Mathematics and Informatics Practices</p>
        
         <dt><b>Accountancy</b></dt>
         <li>Accountancy is the practice of recording, allocating and outlining on trade transactions for a business. It provides an assessment of management concerning the financial outcomes and ranking of an establishment. A few accountancy tasks include recording, classification and reporting of a transaction. When any information is prepared as a report for any individuals or companies to be used outside the organization, the process is known as ‘financial accounting’.</li>
         <dt><b>Business Studies</b></dt>
         <li>Business Studies is a vast subject in the social sciences that allows an in-depth study of a degree of specialities. This would include Finance, Accountancy, Marketing and organisation. It gives an individual a substantial foundation and understanding of how a business should be operated while enhancing communication, operation, strategy and commercial activity skills.</li>
         <dt><b>Economics</b></dt>
         <li>Economics can be explained in different ways. It’s the study of shortage, the study of how people make optimum utilization of resources. It helps people to understand how an individual, companies, and governments make decisions on declared resources to satisfy desires and requirements. It also helps determine how an individual or an organization should organize and coordinate with each other to determine the expected outcome.</li>
         <dt><b>Informatics Practices</b></dt>
         <li> Informatics Practices is a stream of software-related research. The subject primarily covers software, networking concepts and coding. This field corresponds to Computer science, while excluding the hardware concepts, and concentrating more on networking concepts than Computer Science</li>
         <dt><b>Mathematics</b></dt>
         <li>Mathematics is an important part of Commerce as all the methods of economics depend on numbers. With the basic knowledge of maths principles, an individual and an organisation will be able to understand where they position themselves financially in the present and in the future. Most of the organisations use Mathematics in inventory management, marketing, accounting, financial analysis and sales forecasting</li>
         <dt><b>Statistics for Economics</b></dt>
         <li>Many ideas in economic theory, such as functional relationship among variables, are asserted in terms of symbols, algebra, calculus, etc. To examine several economic and social phenomena events, economic theories are better understood and analysed, according to the appropriate numbers. The study of numbers, which is also known as Statistics, represents facts on the basis of a mass of figures. These statistics help in a comparison of facts.</lis>

        <h2>UG Courses available after 12th Commerce:</h2>
        <p>Based on the range of programs available and student enrollment, the two most popular types of undergraduate college degrees are associate's degrees and bachelor's degrees. An associate's degree is at the shortest duration of the two as it usually takes two years to complete, while a bachelor's degree requires four years of study. Credits obtained from an associate's degree can normally be applied to a bachelor's degree program.</p>
          <dt><b> Associate's Degrees:</b> </dt>
          <p>Associate's degrees are typically offered by community colleges and trade schools with awards for general subject areas at this level being conferred as an Associate of Arts (A.A.) or Science (A.S.). More vocational associate's degree programs are available for students looking for more specific professional training. These vocational options include the Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) or even more focused degrees such as the Associate's Degree in Nursing (ADN).</p>
          <dt><b> Bachelor's Degrees:</b> </dt>
           <p>Another common undergraduate degree is the bachelor's degree. Bachelor's degrees are offered at all universities and 4-year colleges in the U.S. The most commonly awarded bachelor's degrees are the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and the Bachelor of Science (B.S.). Some colleges may also offer more specialized degrees such as the Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) or Bachelor's of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.). The award of B.A. is typically for programs in the humanities and social sciences, and the award of B.S. is usually for traditional science programs, although this can vary from one institution to another.
